# Surface water simulation
This is a simple surface ocean water simulation based on a sum of sine functions approach to calculate a height map and get dynamically water surface orientation from GPU in a vertex shader.
Visualization characteristics are provided by Jeremy Bouny water material project for ThreeJS [@jbouny/ocean](https://github.com/jbouny/ocean). 
This Project could be considered a basic implementation of GPU gems chapter 1, named [Effective Water Simulation from Physical Models](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/GPUGems/gpugems_ch01.html) By Mark Finch and Cyan Worlds.
